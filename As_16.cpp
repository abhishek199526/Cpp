/*

Create a base class called shape .Use this class to store two double type values that could be used to 
compute the area of figures , Derive two specific classes called triangle and rectangle from the base
shape .Add to the base class ,a member function get_data() to initialise baseclass datamembers and
another member function display_area() to compute and display the area of figures .Make
display_area() as a virtual function and redefine this function in the derived class to suit their
requirements.
Using these three classes, design a program that will accept dimensions of a triangle or a rectangle
interactively and display the area.
Area of rectangle =x * y
Area of triangle = Â½ * x *y
